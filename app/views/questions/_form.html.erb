<!-- This file '_form.html.erb' is considered to be a partial which means you can include it in any other template (such as new.html.erb and edit.html.erb). You must start the partial name with and underscore '_'. Partials have access to the same instance variables available in the templates (e.g. @question) -->

<%= @question.errors.full_messages.join(", ") %>


<%# If you give the 'form_for' helper an ActiveRecord object that is persisted then the generated form will have an action that submits to 'question_path(@question)' where @question is the ActiveRecord object that you passed to the form. The action will be PATCH (using the _method workaround) %>

<%= form_for @question, :html => {:id => "question_form"} do |f| %>

  <div class="form-group">
    <%= f.label :title  %>  <%# f.label :title, class: "abc" to style %>
